# Dice_Game
This game is a game designed to be very simple to play by using html, css, javascript codes. 
In fact, we can call it a kind of game of chance. If you wish, you can examine the codes from the files. Let's get back to our topic :) 
On the first screen that opens, there is a score table and two player buttons under it. The first player rolls and rolls the dice first, respectively. 
The number of dice changes very quickly and a number comes randomly. then the second player continues the same operations. 
Meanwhile, players can see their up-to-date scores on each roll of the dice from the leaderboard. 
This game goes on mutually for a while and of course it must have an end, right? it shouldn't go on forever :) 
Then I announce the winner: whichever player scores 50 or more points first is the winner. and a notification will appear at the top describing the winner.
